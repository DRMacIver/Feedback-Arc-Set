# Feedback Arc Set solver

This is a library + CLI for solving the following problem:

Given a non-negative nxn matrix W, find a permutation p of [0, n) that maximizes

  sum_{p_i < p_j} W_ij

i.e. we regard W_ij as "the weight of evidence that i < j"

This library is currently ropy as hell and you probably shouldn't use it. Just FYI. But it does appear to work and produces relatively decent results based on trivial testing.

You have been warned...
